## Scraper of a kinopoisk unofficial API:movie_camera:

:wave:Hello and Welcome,


### Our branches:

:round_pushpin:**Scraper_v.1.0** â€” this scraper scraps data from the [Kinopoisk Unofficial API](https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/) in to a .csv file. It not only scraps data but also checks if each movie has a kinopoisk rating and a year. The scraper also converts "Countries" and "Genres" attributes from dictionaries inside list to just list format, which I prefer more.
This scraper has been created especially for [this](https://github.com/DmitryKorzhIT/Telegram_Main_Bot) Telegram Bot.
